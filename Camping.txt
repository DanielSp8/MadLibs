I *vrb to go camping.  I find it is *adj
and *adj.  I once went to *pla,
and I was nearly eaten alive by *ans!
Camping can be a lot of work.  You have to
*vrb firewood, *vr2 water and set up
the tent.  Although it's a lot of work,
it's also *adj!  
I like to see the *adj creation,
which I find very *vin.
You know, I think I want to go camping
now that we're talking about it!
