Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n)
*adj *nou jumping up and down in its tree.
He *vpt *adv through the large tunnel that 
led to its *adj *nou. I got some peanuts 
and passed them through the cage to a 
gigantic gray *nou towering above my head. 
Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went 
to get a *adj scoop of ice cream. It filled 
my stomach. Afterwards I had to *vrb 
*adv to catch our bus.  When I got home I 
*vpt my mom for a *adj day at the zoo.
