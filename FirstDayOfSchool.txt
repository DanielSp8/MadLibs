One very nice morning near the end of summer,
my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake
up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your
first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in
my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got
dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve
*nou with a collar on it, a red tie,
dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n)
*adj hat. In ten minutes I made
lunch and ate my breakfast.  *num
minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I
was at school.
In school, I met two really
*adj kids. All of us became
friends very fast. That day we had Science, and
luckily my friends and I were at the same
*nou.  My friends' names are
*pno and *pno.  In Math we weren't
together, and that really bugged me. We learned what
*pln were, and when to use
them. At snack and recess, we played a game
together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were
*vin off of the ropes onto 
*pln. I thought it was a very
*adj idea. In swimming class,
we needed to swim extremely
*adv, or else we would have to
swim longer.
Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all
my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two
minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I
shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to
my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was
back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!
