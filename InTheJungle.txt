I walk through the color jungle. I take out my
*adj canteen. There's a
*adj parrot with a *adj
*nou in his mouth right there in front
of me in the *adj trees! I gaze at his
*adj *nou. A sudden
sound awakes me from my daydream! A panther’s
*vrb in front of my head! I
*vrb his *adj
breath. I remember I have a packet of *nou
that makes go into a deep slumber! I
*vrb it away from me in front of the
*nou.  Yes he's eating it! I
*vrb away through the
*adj jungle. I meet my parents at the
tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle.
