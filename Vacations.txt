A vacation is when you take a trip to some *adj place
with your *adj family.  Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an *nou or up on a/an *no2.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride *pln
or play *gam or go hunting for *pln.  I like
to spend my time *vin or *vi2.  
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating
three *pln a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around *vin.  Last summer, my little brother
fell in a/an *nou and got poison *plt all
over his *bdp.  My family is going to go to (the)
*pla, and I will practice *vin.  Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very
*adj and because they have to work *num
hours every day all year making enough *pln to pay
for the vacation.
